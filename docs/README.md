# CreatorVault Documentation

This repo keeps the root clean (only `README.md`) and historically stored project documentation under `docs/`.

## Status

Most legacy docs have been **archived** to `archive/docs/` as part of cleaning up deprecated deployment flows.
If you’re looking for guides, check:

- `archive/docs/` (historical docs; stubs may point you to git history for full content)
- `README.md` (current high-level overview)

If you need anything restored or re-written as “current canonical docs”, say which flow you want documented (deploy, activate, rewards/bribes, etc.) and I’ll regenerate a clean, accurate guide.
