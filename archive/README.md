## Archived legacy material

This folder contains **legacy / deprecated** contracts, scripts, tests, docs, and deployment artifacts that we’ve removed from the active build and active documentation.

- **Purpose**: keep the main repo focused on the current phased deploy flow (`CreatorVaultDeployer`) while still preserving pointers for historical context.
- **Deletion**: safe to delete this entire folder once you no longer need historical references.
- **Full content**: if any archived file is a short placeholder, the original full content remains in git history prior to archival.
