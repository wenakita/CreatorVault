Internal Linking Rules:

- Link safety:
  - Only link to canonical URLs (no sort/filter/pagination/tracking params).
  - Do not recommend links to `noindex` pages or to parameterized variants; link to the hub/entity URL instead.

- Creator pages MUST link to:
  - Their Vaults
  - Relevant Categories/Tags
  - 3–5 related Creators (contextual)

- Vault pages MUST link to:
  - Their Creator
  - Relevant Category/Tag hubs
  - Related Vaults when appropriate

- Category pages MUST link to:
  - Top Creators
  - Top Vaults
  - Related Categories

- Avoid footer or sitewide link spam
- Prefer contextual links inside content sections
