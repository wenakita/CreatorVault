Indexing & Canonical Rules:

- Crawlability gate (blocking):
  - If we can't reliably serve meaningful HTML + correct metadata to crawlers (SSR/prerender), default to `noindex` until fixed (even for Creator/Vault).
- Only one canonical URL per content entity
- Sort, filter, pagination, and tracking parameters MUST not create indexable URLs
  - Examples: `?page=`, `?sort=`, `?filter=`, `?tag=`, `utm_*`, `gclid`, etc.
  - These variants should be `noindex` and canonicalize to the hub/entity URL (strip params).
  - Robots for variants: `noindex,follow` (canonical is not a substitute for `noindex`).
- Paginated pages must use rel=canonical to the main hub
- Canonical alone is not enough:
  - If variants are discoverable (links, sitemaps, internal search), they still need `noindex` to avoid accidental indexation.
- If content value is ambiguous, default to `noindex`

When unsure:
- Ask before marking a page indexable
