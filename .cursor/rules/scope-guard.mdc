- SEO/indexing/metadata/internal-linking rules apply only to the frontend web app (typically `frontend/` in this repo).
- The contracts workspace (solidity, hardhat/foundry, onchain deps) is not a \"page\".
- If the current file/package.json lacks `react`/`vite`/`next`, do not assume this is a frontend page or that Next.js APIs apply.
- When asked “optimize this page”, first confirm the deployed frontend root (Vercel rootDirectory, `vercel.json`, or the `package.json` that contains `react`/`vite`/`next`) before proposing SEO changes.
- If unsure, run the repo’s stack detection command and only then give framework-specific guidance.
