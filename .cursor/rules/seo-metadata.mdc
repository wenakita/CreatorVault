SEO Metadata Rules:

- All indexable pages MUST use a centralized metadata generator (framework-appropriate)
  - Next.js App Router: `generateMetadata` / layout metadata
  - Vite/React Router (SPA): centralized helper (e.g. `react-helmet-async`) and/or pre-render/SSR for SEO-critical routes
- Crawlability gate (blocking):
  - If metadata cannot be served reliably to crawlers (SPA-only), default the page to `noindex` until SSR/prerender is available for that route.
- Titles must be unique per URL and intent-aligned
- Descriptions must summarize value, not stuff keywords
- Robots must be explicitly defined and match the indexability decision (`index,follow` vs `noindex,follow`)
- Canonical URLs must be explicitly defined (one per entity) and should be absolute (production origin, e.g. `https://creatorvault.fun/...`)
- Open Graph and Twitter metadata are required for indexable pages

If metadata is missing or duplicated:
- Treat it as a blocking issue (default the page to `noindex` until fixed)
