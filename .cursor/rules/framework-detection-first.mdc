Framework detection first:

- Before giving Next.js-specific recommendations (App Router, RSC, generateMetadata), confirm the actual frontend framework and router from the repo.
- If the stack is not Next.js App Router, do not mention app/ routes, RSC, or Next-only APIs.
- If stack is unclear, ask a single clarifying question OR provide two short branches: (Next.js App Router) vs (Vite/React/other).
