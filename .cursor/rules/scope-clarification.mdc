Scope Clarification Rules:

- SEO, indexing, metadata, and internal linking apply ONLY to user-facing frontend routes/pages/components.
- Litmus test:
  - If the file is not under `frontend/` (or otherwise confirmed as the deployed frontend root), treat it as NOT a page.
- Solidity contracts, backend logic, and infrastructure files are NOT pages.
- Do NOT apply SEO concepts to non-UI code.
- If a request says “this page” and the file is not a frontend route/component:
  - Ask for clarification before proceeding.
- See also: `scope-guard` for framework/root detection guardrails.
