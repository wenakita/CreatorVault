Project: creatorvault.fun

Domain model (authoritative):
- Creator is the primary entity
- Vault is a product/offering owned by a Creator
- Categories/Tags are discovery and SEO hub pages

SEO rules (must follow):
- Treat Creator and Vault pages as indexable by default
- Filtered or sorted URLs MUST be noindex and canonicalized
- Avoid duplicate content across Creator and Vault pages
- Every indexable page MUST provide unique, user-visible value
- Do not generate doorway pages or thin list pages

Architecture rules (must follow):
- Always follow `framework-detection-first` before suggesting framework-specific APIs.
- Current stack is **Vite + React Router (SPA)** (deployed from `frontend/` on Vercel).
- For pages intended to rank, prefer **pre-rendering or SSR** when available; if we can't reliably serve content + metadata to crawlers, default to `noindex` until fixed.
- If/when the repo is migrated to **Next.js App Router**, then use App Router conventions and prefer SSG/ISR; use SSR only when clearly justified.
- Centralize SEO metadata generation and internal linking logic (data-driven; avoid sitewide spam).
- Do NOT rely on client-side-only SEO hacks for indexable pages.

Content rules (strict):
- Do NOT add AI-fluff or filler copy
- Do NOT make financial guarantees or misleading claims
- Use neutral, factual, creator-first language
- Optimize for clarity and trust over hype

If a requested change violates any rule above:
- Call it out explicitly
- Propose a compliant alternative
