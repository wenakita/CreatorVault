Performance is an SEO feature.

- Consider LCP, CLS, and TTFB in all recommendations
- Prefer server-rendering or pre-rendering when possible (Next.js: Server Components; SPA: prerender/SSR for SEO-critical routes)
- Avoid unnecessary client-side JS
- Optimize images and data fetching by default

If a change harms performance:
- Call it out explicitly
