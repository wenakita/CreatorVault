/**
 * @title Upgrade Vault Preview Function
 * @notice This script is for upgrading the vault to fix the previewCapitalInjection function
 * @dev The vault needs to be upgradeable for this to work. If not, you'll need to deploy a new vault.
 * 
 * CRITICAL FIX:
 * - previewCapitalInjection now properly converts USD1 to WLFI value using wlfiEquivalent()
 * - Before: Was adding raw USD1 amount (1 USD1 = 1 WLFI in calculation)
 * - After: Converts USD1 to WLFI value (1 USD1 ≈ 8.33 WLFI at $1/$0.12 ratio)
 * 
 * This fixes the preview calculation to show accurate impact of capital injections.
